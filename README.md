# QuantRisk

Small project to showcase my experience with quantitative risk management.
Covers Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) measures based on either distribution assumptions and/or volatility forecasts.

If you notice any errors or have any questions/suggestions, please reach out via LinkedIn! ***https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanzollmann/*** 

Potential improvements:
- [ ] use more sophisticated volatility models instead of basic garch models e.g. HAR
- [ ] functionality to parse multiple assets in one go
- [ ] improve documentation of classes. Currently no docstrings for individual methods.
